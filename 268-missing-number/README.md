Given an array containing _n_ distinct numbers taken from `0, 1, 2, ..., n`, find the one that is missing from the array.

For example,

Given _nums_ = `[0, 1, 3]` return `2`.

**Note:**

Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant extra space complexity?

```
nums = []
```
is expected to get `0`.

```
nums = [0, 1, 2, 3]
```
is expected to get `4`.

```
[1, 2, 3, 4]
```
is expected to get `0`.

```
[0, 2, 3, 4]
```
is expected to get `1`.
