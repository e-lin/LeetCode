Problem

Given two non-negative numbers `num1` and `num2` represented as string, return the sum of `num1` and `num2`.

**Note:**

1. The length of both `num1` and `num2` is < 5100.
2. Both `num1` and `num2` contains only digits `0-9`.
3. Both `num1` and `num2` does not contain any leading zero.
**4. You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly.**
