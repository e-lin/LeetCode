Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.

**Example:**

Given _nums1_ = `[1, 2, 2, 1]`, _nums2_ = `[2, 2]`, return `[2, 2]`.

**Note:**

- Each element in the result should appear as many times as it shows in both arrays.
- The result can be in any order.

**Follow up:**

- What if the given array is already sorted? How would you optimize your algorithm?
- What if _nums1_'s size is small compared to _nums2_'s size? Which algorithm is better?
- What if elements of _nums2_ are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you cannot load all elements into the memory at once?


For example,

```
[1,2]
[1,1]
```
is expected to get `[1]`.

```
[3, 7, 1, 2, 5]
[1, 2, 3, 7]
```
is expected to get `[1, 2, 3, 7]`.

```
[2,1,1,2,2]
[1,1,2]
```
is expected to get `[1,1,2]`.
