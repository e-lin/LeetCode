101. Symmetric Tree
---

### 1.
You can leverage this problems with `226. Invert Binary Tree` and `100. Same Tree`.


### 2.
Invert a binary tree:

``` python
def invertTree(self, root):
    x = TreeNode(0) #dummy head
    if root is not None:
        x.val = root.val

```

### 3.
Use recursion to check if two trees are same.

``` python

```
