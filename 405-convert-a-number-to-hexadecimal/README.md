Given an integer, write an algorithm to convert it to hexadecimal. For negative integer, [twoâ€™s complement][R1] method is used.

**Note:**

1. All letters in hexadecimal (`a-f`) must be in lowercase.
2. The hexadecimal string must not contain extra leading `0`s. If the number is zero, it is represented by a single zero character `'0'`; otherwise, the first character in the hexadecimal string will not be the zero character.
3. The given number is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
4. You **must not use _any_ method provided by the library** which converts/formats the number to hex directly.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
26

Output:
"1a"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
-1

Output:
"ffffffff"
```
