Given two strings _s_ and _t_, write a function to determine if _t_ is an anagram of _s_.

For example,

```
s = "anagram", t = "nagaram", return true.
s = "rat", t = "car", return false.
```

**Note:**

You may assume the string contains only lowercase alphabets.

**Follow up:**

What if the inputs contain unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such case?
