Problem
---
You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**.

for example,

```
[]
```
is expected to get `0`.

```
[0]
```
is expected to get `0`.

```
[2,3,2]
```
is expected to get `4`.

```
[1,3,1,3,100]
```
is expected to get `103`.
