Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in place such that each element appear only **_once_** and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this in place with constant memory.

For example,

Given input array _nums_ = `[1,1,2]`,

Your function should return length = `2`, with the first two elements of _nums_ being `1` and `2` respectively. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

Follow up for "Remove Duplicates": What if duplicates are allowed at most twice?

For example,

Given sorted array nums = `[1,1,1,2,2,3]`,

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being `1, 1, 2, 2 and 3`. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.
