Invert a binary tree.

```
     4
   /   \
  2     7
 / \   / \
1   3 6   9
```
to

```
     4
   /   \
  7     2
 / \   / \
9   6 3   1
```

for example,

```
[]
```
is expected to get `[]`.

**Trivia:**

This problem was inspired by [this original tweet][R1] by [Max Howell][R2]:

> Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you canâ€™t invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so fuck off.
