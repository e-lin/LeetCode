Given a binary tree and a sum, find all root-to-leaf paths where each path's sum equals the given sum.

For example:

Given the below binary tree and `sum = 22`,

```
              5
             / \
            4   8
           /   / \
          11  13  4
         /  \    / \
        7    2  5   1
```

return

```
[
   [5,4,11,2],
   [5,8,4,5]
]
```

Another example, input:
```
[1,2]
1
```
is expected to get `[]`.
